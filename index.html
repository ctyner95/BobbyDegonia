                <h3>About Bobby</h3>
                <p>The day Bobby DeGonia was born, everyone knew he was bound to be a musician and would give something amazing to the world. At the age of 6 Bobby started playing the guitar, learning everything he could from his father and grandfather, both of whom were guitarists. Bobby took to it naturally and learned quickly, honing his skills over the next few years and starting his first band at the age of 11. His group soon became the house band at the VFW in Joplin, Mo., and Bobby also played guitar and drums in his father’s band for many years. In 1996 Bobby took a big step, founding a new Country band with some of the other best players in the region – they named it Livewire and later took their show on the road. Livewire toured all over the United States opening for several big-name artists: Dierks Bentley, Toby Keith, John Anderson, Ricochet and more. Livewire landed a Nashville Indie record-label deal in 2010, and Bobby and Livewire went on to chart a string of singles on Country radio. In 2015 they were awarded the honor of Texas Regional Radio’s “New Group of the Year.” Bobby recently began performing and recording under his own name, and he currently performs about 200 shows per year with an all-star regional cast of supporting musicians. He has built a solid and loyal fan base, and in October will release his first single, “Forever In My Dreams.”</p>
